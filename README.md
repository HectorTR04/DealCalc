A very simple Jetpack Compose application written in Kotlin to calculate the best energydrink deal through user input. 
Input the name of the drink, the price, the amount of cans and the millilitres per can to output a list showing the best deals in order by the lowest cost per ml.
Don't enter to many because they won't all display, this version does not include scrolling :)
